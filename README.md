Here, I have tried to make like a Contact App.

Here we can do many things:
 # List Contacts

 # Add a Contact
 <img src="https://github.com/Anuj-yadav1999/Contacts-App/blob/master/z_images/second-pic.PNG" width="700">

 # Edit Contact
 <img src="https://github.com/Anuj-yadav1999/Contacts-App/blob/master/z_images/third-pic.PNG" width="700">

 # Delete Contact
 <img src="https://github.com/Anuj-yadav1999/Contacts-App/blob/master/z_images/fourth-pic.PNG" width="700">

 Feel Free to download it and try it your own way.
 Make sure to install the dependencies.
 
 Happy Coding!!
